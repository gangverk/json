	<h1>Actions and conditions documentation</h1>


	<h2>Actions</h2>
	<p>The actions may have dependencies on their context, e.g. actions only make sense when they are executed in a certain context, such as PLAY_TRAILER action when a user is viewing details on a movie but does not make sense when user is viewing a mosaic of movies. The client has to ensure actions are performed in correct context states.</p>

	<h3>OPEN_TV</h3>

	</div>

	<h3>OPEN</h3>
	<div class="section">

	</div>

	<h3>PLAY_TRAILER</h3>
	<div class="section">
		<p>Create a playback for trailer and start playing.</p>
		<p>This should use the id of the content being viewed to create a playback using the rest service, and launch the playback view using the returned ticket.</p>
		<p>Only performed when content details view is displayed. The "type" should be "movie" in the structure object.</p>

		<h4>REST</h4>
		<p>Create playback</p>

"viaccessContentId": null,
"viaccessScrambled": null
}</pre>		
	</div>

	<h3>ORDER</h3>
	<div class="section">
		<p>Post an order for a content, create a playback and start playing.</p>
		<p>Use the id of the content being viewed to create an order. After posting an order a playback must be created for that order. Once a playback is created the playback view can be launched using the returned ticket.</p>
		<p>Only performed when content details view is displayed. The "type" should be "movie" in the structure object.</p>

		<h4>REST</h4>
		<p>Post order (retrieve/create an order, it either creates a new one or returns an existing one).</p>
		<pre>POST {service_root}/orders

"mainAccount":false,
"offerId":null,
"position":null,
"macAddress":"00:1c:a8:ac:c3:df"
}</pre>		
	
	<p>Using the "id" from the order response a playback can be created for that order:</p>
	<pre>POST http://157.157.4.37//rest-api/orders/37447863/playback/{clientIpAddress}</pre>
	<p>Example response:</p>
	<pre>{

"position":null,
"viaccessContentId":null,
"viaccessScrambled":null
}</pre>

	</div>

	<h3>RESUME</h3>
	<div class="section">
		<p>Identical to "ORDER".</p>

	</div>




	<h2>Conditions</h2>
	<p>Conditions are only used for button elements in a list.</p>
	<p>For each button element in a list, a specified condition must be met in order for that button to be displayed. If it does not meet the condition then the next button in the list should take its place.</p>
	<p>Conditional checks may depend on their viewing context, e.g. checking if movie is in current rentals only makes sense if the user is viewing the movie details.</p>

	<h3>IN_CURRENT_RENTALS</h3>
	<div class="section">
